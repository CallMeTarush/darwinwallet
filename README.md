============

Blinddroid Wallet is an Android app that enables blind and visually impaired users to quickly recognize paper money. It uses the phone's camera to detect currency denominations for US, UK, Canadian, European Union, Australian and belarusian bills. Simply hold the bill in front of the phone's camera and the app will speak its value
It is forked from great Darwin Wallet app by Matt Hill.
Check it out on the Android App Store:
